# Notebooks


This repo purpose is creating a hub for all my graduate and undergraduate notes for most of my classes. My undergraduate classes was on Universidad Nacional de Colombia (National University of Colombia) where I spent 5 years. 


## Content

This repo will not be distributed by undergraduate courses versus graduate courses fue to the fact I consider the undergraduate courses were imparted as graduate level, and also because not all courses will be in this repo. Indeed, most courses here will have coding and not all the courses had that code content within its syllabus. 

Each course in this repo has its own `README.md` and coding files mostly Jupiter notebooks for simplicity.


## Courses


The time spent at Universidad Nacional de Colombia was surprisingly challenging. I must say that the academic level at Universidad Nacional de Colombia is on par with that of many universities, if not superior. Professionals such as Professor Gonzalo Medina cheer me up to learn and take me most out of me every second. Although I wished to keep all the notes from the undergraduate courses, I have some which I will consider uploading to this repository. At the very least, my undergraduate research will definitely have a space here.

My graduate courses provided a great opportunity to focus all the previous knowledge I had from college and apply it to hot topics such as Machine Learning, AI, and Deep Learning. It was also an opportunity to choose my job area and grow from there. I am deeply thank to professors such as Erwin Suazo and Tamer Oraby thesis supervisor and co-supervisor respectively, whom taught me more than science.
